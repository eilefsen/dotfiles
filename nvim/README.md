## Pylance

This part of the config is arguably the most likely to break.  
Most likely, you cant use the newest version of pylance.

1. Simply install the extension in vscode.
2. If you need an older version, click the arrow next to "uninstall", then "install another version".
3. Paste everything below the "pylance" key in coc-settings.json.
    * Most important of these, the "env" key
